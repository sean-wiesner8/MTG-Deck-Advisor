# Format: Any line that begins with a '#' character is considered to be a comment and is not considered by the program.
# Empty lines are ignored.
# Card input should be in the format "{card name}; {count}", where each card is separated by a new line.
# A line consisting of a single '*' character signals the end of the deck input. 
# The following line of the input is the name of the archetype that your deck belongs to.
# The final line of the input is an integer representing the number of decks you would like the program to output.
# Example: Deck containing three distinct cards (remove comment signals)
# Mountain; 10
# Furnace Punisher; 4
# Khenra Spellspear // Gitaxian Spellstalker; 2
# *
# Red Deck Wins
# 3
